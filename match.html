        Match is a concrete match-curing system that creates a controlled environment for curing concrete samples, replicating real-time site conditions. The device functions as a custom-designed environmental chamber, pulling real-time setpoints from the cloud
        via other EXACT products.

        As the sole mechanical designer for most of the project, I was responsible for the complete mechanical design and physical validation testing. My solution featured a custom metal enclosure with a rear-mounted TEC unit, while an internal metal cage optimized
        airflow to ensure uniform temperature distribution.
        </br>
        </br>
        Serviceability was a critical design factor, as failures could lead to project delays. To address this, I designed the system for modularityâ€”all components are easily replaceable, and all connectors, harnesses, and mounting features are uniquely designed
        and fully accessible to users. The device is currently concluding the DVT phase, and before my departure from EXACT, I had completed most of the PVT design.
