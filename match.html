        Match is a concrete match-curing system used to cure concrete samples in a controlled environment, matching temperature to real-time site conditions. The device is essentially a custom designed environmental chamber capable of pulling real-time setpoints
        from the cloud from other EXACT products.

        </br>
        As the sole mechanical designer for most of the project, I was responsible for the entire design and physical validation testing of the product. My solution was a custom designed metal enclosure that accepts a TEC unit on the rear. The metal cage inside
        is designed to facilitate airflow for uniform temperature throughout the chamber. It was also incredibly vital that the unit is easily servicable by our clients, as potential failures can lead to delayed timelines. The device is extremely modular,
        and all parts can be replaced with ease. All connectors and harnesses are completely unique, and all mounting features and accessible by the user. The device is currently ending the DVT phase, and I was able to complete most of the PVT design
        before the end of my time with EXACT.
