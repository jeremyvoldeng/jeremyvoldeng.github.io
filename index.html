	<p class="bio">
		I am a recent UBC Engineering Physics graduate with an interest in robotics and mechanical design. I am
		living in
		Vancouver, but am planning to continue my career in Toronto in May 2022. Here is a list of things I have
		done.
		</br>
		</br>
		</br>
		>In 2018 I worked at <b><a href="http://logicandform.com/">Logic & Form</a></b> as a Creative Software
		Developer
		for 4 months. We developed <b><a href="http://logicandform.com/work/interactive-wall/">this</a></b>
		interactive display.
		</br>
		</br>
		>I built an autonomous robot in a team of four people during the summer of 2018. See
		<b><a href="https://robotjoel2018.wordpress.com/">here</a></b>.
		</br>
		</br>
		>I currently work for <b><a href="https://snowspines.com/password">Snow Spines Inc.</a></b> developing an
		electronic
		assist for mountaineering and cross country skiing.
		</br>
		</br>
		>I developed an <b><a href="https://github.com/jeremyvoldeng/legoMosaicMaker">app</a></b> that creates Lego
		portraits
		from any image, and creates an instruction booklet for building.
		</br>
		</br>
		>In the school year of 2020-2021 I worked with a team of 4 to develop a deGuassing system for
		<b><a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a></b> that removed remnate magnetization from
		PCBs used in a quantum processor.
		</br>
		</br>
		See my <b><a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/">resume</a></b> for more information.
