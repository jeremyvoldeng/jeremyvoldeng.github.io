        RFID/NFC Card Embedded in Concrete for High Volume On-Site Tracking
    </p>

    <p class="bio">
        Tag is a simple two-piece product embedded in concrete forms, consisting of an RFID card and a plastic card holder. I was responsible for designing the card holder and sourcing a supplier.
        </br>
        </br>
        My solution was an injection-molded holder featuring two pins to secure it to the mold and two chamfered posts to keep it in place when concrete is poured. The chamfered design accommodates slight variations in hole size and compensates for wear over
        time. The plastic RFID card fits securely within the holder, ensuring easy installation and firm retention. I also sourced a supplier that offered extremely low costs at high volumes, enabling EXACT to sell Tag in bulk at a competitive price.
