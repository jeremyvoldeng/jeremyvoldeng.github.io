        RFID/NFC Card Embedded in Concrete for High Volume On-Site Tracking
    </p>
    </br>
    </br>
    <p class="bio">
        EXACT is a simple 2 piece product that is placed inside concrete forms and embedded in concrete. The product is made up of an RFID card and a plastic card holder. I was responsible for designing the card holder and sourcing a supplier.
        </br>
        My solution was a simple injection molded piece with 2 pins to hold the part in place on the mold, and 2 posts to secure the part when concrete is poured in the form. The posts are chamfered to allow a small range of hole sizes and eventual wear down
        of the forms. The plastic RFID card is easily installed and held in place firmly. I was able to find a supplier for this product with an extremely low price at high volumes, allowing EXACT to sell these at low cost and high bulk.
