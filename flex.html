        Sophisticated, Ruggedized Temperature Monitoring for the Concrete Industry

        Flex is a durable and versatile temperature monitoring device designed for the concrete industry. It supports up to four temperature sensors and records measurements at preset intervals. Every quarter hour, it uploads data to the cloud, enabling clients
        to monitor conditions via our online portal.

        As the sole mechanical designer on the project, I was responsible for the entire mechanical design and physical validation testing. My solution featured a three-piece injection-molded shell with custom-designed connectors and multiple mounting options.
        The PCBA was housed within a secondary shell, allowing the device to be sealed with potting compound while still enabling PCBA recovery in rare failure scenarios.
        </br>
        </br>
        To ensure durability and waterproofing—critical for the concrete industry—I incorporated a custom EPDM gasket and partial potting. Through DFMEA, I conducted drop tests, waterproofing tests, and thermal cycling to validate performance. Additionally, I
        supported our in-house production team in preparing for assembly and facilitated the transition to contract manufacturing.
