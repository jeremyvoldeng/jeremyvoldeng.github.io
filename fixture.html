        EXACT Test Fixture

    <p class="degree">
        Bed of nails test fixture used for PCBA validation and data collection during production
    </p>

        This test fixture was designed to validate the PCBAs used in Flex devices before they entered production. I was responsible for developing Python scripts to automate the testing of all board functionalities.
        </br>
        </br>
        The Flex PCBA featured LTE, LoRa, and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as RTC, analog, and 1W probe ports, among other components. I created a suite of scripts capable of testing each feature, assigning a unique ID to each board, and registering it to
        EXACT’s online portal—all within a two-minute testing window.
        </br>
        </br>
        To ensure ease of use for production staff, I designed an intuitive touchscreen interface using Tkinter, with clear visual indicators for real-time error detection. The system automatically logged all results to Google Sheets, where data was extracted
        via AppSheet to generate visual reports for tracking failure modes and overall success rates.
