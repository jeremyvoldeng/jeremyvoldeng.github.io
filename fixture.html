        Bed of nails test fixture used for PCBA validation and data collection during production

    <p class="bio">
        This test fixture was used for testing the PCBAs used for <b><a href="flex.html">Flex </a></b> devices. I was responsible for writing the Python scripts to test all functionality on each board before it was used in production.
        </br>
        </br>
        The Flex PCBA had an extensive list of features, including LTE, LoRa and Bluetooth connectivity, RTC, analog and 1W probe ports, and more. I developed a set of scripts capable of testing each individual feature on the board, assigning a unique ID to the
        board after testing, and registering it to EXACT's online portal automatically and within a 2 minute time frame. The interface for the device had to be intuitive for production staff to use regularly, and extremely robust to ensure all failures
        are captured at this stage of testing. I used TKinter for simple GUI display on a touch screen interface, with simple indicators for staff to see errors as they happen. All results were automatically uploaded to a Google Sheet, where data was
        then extracted using AppSheet to generate visual data to easily see failure modes and overall success rates.
